As part of a class project in my fluid dynamics class, we analyzed an accordion to understand how fluid dynamics principles apply to everyday mechanical systems. By disassembling the instrument, we examined how air flows through the bellows and reed chambers, focusing on pressure differences created by compressing and expanding the bellows. We observed how changes in volume directly affect airflow velocity and pressure, enabling sound production through vibrating reeds. The project connected core fluid concepts to a familiar object, demonstrating how controlled airflow can be harnessed to produce accoustist outputs. Below is a link to the a youtube video my group and I put togeter to fully dicuss the dissection.
