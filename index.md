## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_8324.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Brianna Cheng. I’m a passionate and hands-on mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a deep curiosity for how systems move, interact, and perform under real-world conditions. My experiences span from machining custom sensor mounts and optimizing thermal systems at Teradar to designing cooling enclosures, buoy guards, and robotic frameworks through Cornell’s Autonomous Boat and Motion teams. I thrive at the intersection of design and analysis—using CAD, FEA, and prototyping tools to turn creative ideas into functional, manufacturable mechanisms. Whether developing interactive installations that blend mechanics with art or refining autonomous systems for competition, I’m driven by a love for problem-solving, precision, and collaboration that pushes engineering innovation forward.
