#### Projects
- **Helicopter Mount**:  
  *Rigid adpatbale cross beam mount to hold sensor at various angles for aerial data colletion*  
  - Sensor's first successful large scale aerial data collection above 8,000 ft
  - Proved sensors ability to support air to ground surveying

- **PCIE Enclosure**:  
  *Water resistant, air cooling enclosure for PCIE card*  
  - Support full frame data collection on sensors in various testing scenarios
  - Numberous mounting capabilities: tripods, robot arm, lab bench, and moving testing vehicles (Jeep, Go-cart, etc.)  

- **Go-Kart Mount**:  
  *Adjustable gimbal mount on go-cart used to suspend different trihedrals for fast frame data colelction*  
  - Mount was undetectable by sensor allowing isolation of trihedral 
  - Compatible with various sized trihedrals or other testing objects
 

#### Autoboat Team Projects
- **Boat Hull Design and Manufacturing**:  
  -Iterating, modeling, and running simulation on boat designs to find best design for competition
- **Battery enclosure**:  
  -Mounting plates and enclosures to hold batteries that power all electrical component in the boat 
- **Bouy Guards**:  
  -TPU printed guards used to deflect head on collisions and prevent buoys from getting caught between the main hull and almas
